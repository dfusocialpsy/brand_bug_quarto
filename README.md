# _brand Bug

I would like to use _brand.yml for reveal.js, typst, and dashboards in Quarto. I would especially like to use a logo for all outputs. Thank you for _brand already.

It works perfectly for reveal.js.

However, the logo is not included in the dashboard.

Typst does not render at all.

Any help is much appreciated.
