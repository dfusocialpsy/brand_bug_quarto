# _brand Bug

I would like to use _brand.yml for reveal.js, typst, and dashboards in Quarto. I would especially like to use a logo for all outputs. Thank you for _brand already.

It works perfectly for reveal.js.

However, the logo is not included in the dashboard.

Typst does not render at all.

Any help is much appreciated.

Here is my file structure:

.
└── brand_bug
    ├── brand
    │   └── _brand.yml
    ├── dashboard
    │   └── dash_test.qmd
    ├── logos
    │   └── my_logo.svg
    ├── revealjs
    │   └── reveal_test.qmd
    └── typst
        └── typst_test.qmd
